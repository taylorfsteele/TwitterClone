### Notes

This project has two main goals. Firstly, to learn and demonstrate TypeScript in a large scale project, and slowly scale up its featureset throughout the application. Secondly, to better think about UI and UX design early on in the coding process.

Normally, I frontload my projects with the "hard" coding first; that is, any sort of invloved logic or algorithms that involve novel data manipulation that I might not be accustomed to. This often involves putting a lot of effort into the backend of an application, and not a lot on the front end. This time, I wanted to take the reverse approach, and spend a good deal making sure the user experience felt like a fully fledged application. Cloning a well-known application like Twitter fit this challenge well, as users would know immedialty if the experience felt right. And since Dark Themes are pretty much mandatory now, I added that as well.
